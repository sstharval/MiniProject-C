# Requirements
## Introduction:
**1.** An airline reservation system (ARS) is part of the passenger
      service systems (PSS), which are applications supporting the direct contact with
      the passenger.
  
  
**2.** ARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system (CRS). A
       computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and
       interfaces with a global distribution system (GDS) which supports travel agencies
       and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a
       single system.
  
  
**3.** Earlier people have to visit airline company’s centers to
       book tickets and had to wait for hours in the queue. Or they have to book 
       tickets on phone, there also waiting for minutes to complete the booking process. 
       But now with just a few clicks, your ticket is booked. Travelers just have to enter 
       minimum information to book tickets. It’s so easy now to book flights!
       
       
**4.** This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to enhance my C programming 
       understanding and apply SDLC concepts.
