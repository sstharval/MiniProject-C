# Requirements
## Introduction:
1.An airline reservation system (ARS) is part of the passenger
  service systems (PSS), which are applications supporting the direct contact with
  the passenger.
2.ARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system (CRS). A
  computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and
  interfaces with a global distribution system (GDS) which supports travel agencies
  and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a
  single system.
3. Earlier people have to visit airline company’s centers to
 book tickets and had to wait for hours in the queue. Or they have to book 
 tickets on phone, there also waiting for minutes to complete the booking process. 
 But now with just a few clicks, your ticket is booked. Travelers just have to enter 
 minimum information to book tickets. It’s so easy now to book flights!
 4.This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to enhance my C programming understanding and apply SDLC concepts.
