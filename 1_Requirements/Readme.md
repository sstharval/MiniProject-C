# Requirements
## Introduction:
**1.** An airline reservation system (ARS) is part of the passenger
      service systems (PSS), which are applications supporting the direct contact with
      the passenger.
  
  
**2.** ARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system (CRS). A
       computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and
       interfaces with a global distribution system (GDS) which supports travel agencies
       and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a
       single system.
  
  
**3.** Earlier people have to visit airline company’s centers to
       book tickets and had to wait for hours in the queue. Or they have to book 
       tickets on phone, there also waiting for minutes to complete the booking process. 
       But now with just a few clicks, your ticket is booked. Travelers just have to enter 
       minimum information to book tickets. It’s so easy now to book flights!
       
       
**4.** This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to enhance my C programming 
       understanding and apply SDLC concepts. 



### Benefits:
ARS offer a range of benefits, here are just a few of them:

1.Easy to book tickets

2.Saves time and money

3.Send automated tickets to the customer by mail

4.Easy cancellation and Refund Policies


## Ageing -Time & Feature evolution
| Time    | Feature |
| -----   | -----   | 
| NA      |         |

## Defining Our System Basic Requirements:
1.Reservation of seat

2.Save record to file 

3.Display of records

4.Cancellation of records

5.Update Record

6.Exiting from the screen 



### Certain assumptions:

1. Maximum number of seats booked in this system is 100 (We can expand whenever required)

2. System will take your passport number, your name, email address and destination for reservation

3. Analytic System is already present

4. ARS interfaces with a Global Distribution System (GDS)

5. Communication and other Services


 This project builds airline reservation system with certain features, other features can also be added
 for instance adding payement options, multi-lingual system, automatic communication, advanced reporting,
 mobile management and many more.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H:

## Who:
-:For small to large travel and ticket agencies 


## What:
-:Many travel and ticket agencies that are not able to afford high ARS Management Systems 
Without log in page agencies can easily reserve or cancel their customers booking

## When:
-:In 1978, due to the economy and the emergence of new types of jets, government stopped controlling fares, prices, and routes, 
as well as market entry. That made the airline industry a free market new players could enter while existing carriers now could
set their own prices and establish new routes.Seeing the opportunities, airlines started to share CRSs with non-competing carriers,
opening access to multiple airline’s inventories via a single terminal. Carriers that participated in distribution through CRS had 
to pay a commission to be available through the platform. Those events in the market led to the emergence of a new term: 
Global Distribution System or GDS.Airlines now gained over 60 percent of bookings from travel and ticket agencies.

## Where:
-:This system is international
